## Essentially, what is Workn?
Workn is a web platform, whose main goal is to make a "match" or combination between two people, an employer or job offeror, and a person who is looking to meet this need, the match is made automatically based on variables such as the skill set or occupation of the person and the requirements of the job offer, in this way the most suitable employees are located for the offers. 

In addition to this main functionality, it will also allow the manual search for people and offers. In short, a smart jobs platform.

## The Motivation and Concept

The Workn platform was born as a result of a resident improvement opportunity in the field of platforms for obtaining employment in the Dominican Republic. After the conception of the idea, with a survey, we found out that although there are various applications and sites that meet this objective, none of them meets all the specific objectives.


## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`


**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Running the repository
